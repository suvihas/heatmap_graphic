To demonstrate a change in conditions (in terms of temperature or co2) in a building, we can animate the gradient fills of the floorplate to show change of temperature over time. The slow transition animation gives a visual indication of change in condition. 

Tools used: HTML5 Canvas element, chroma library, Browser RequestAnimationFrame feature to keep things simple.
